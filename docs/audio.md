# Audio Settings

## Busses

There are three audio busses:

- Master -> Controls the overall level of volume output to the player
- Music -> Controls specifically the volume of the music
- SFX -> Controls specifically the volume of the sound effects

## Control

These busses are adjustable in the settings menu.

Start the Music & SFX sliders at full, but set master to 50% by default.
